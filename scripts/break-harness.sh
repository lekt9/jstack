# Break into a full fib-harness when a 7-step Jesus Loop step can't close
# in one pass. Creates (or reuses) a workspace, registers the step as the
# harness's scope, and writes the workspace path into the loop's state so
# the hook knows to keep us on this step until the harness verdict lands.
#
# Usage:
#   break-harness.sh --step 3 --scope "API routing skeleton (step 3 land)"
#
# After the harness runs its 20-agent cycle (see scripts/fib-harness),
# read the resulting verdict.json. When verdict is `promote`, clear
# harness_ws from the state file and the next hook call advances the
# main loop to step N+1.

🕊 Harness break engaged for Step $STEP.
   scope:     $SCOPE

Next: write a 6-dimension JSON scoped to "$SCOPE" and register with:
  $PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/fib-harness dimensions "$WS" @dimensions.json

Then run the 20-agent cycle (L1=1, L2=1, L3=2, L4=3, L5=5, L6=8),
collect each agent's hypothesis, then:
  $PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/fib-harness judge   "$WS"
  $PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/fib-harness verdict "$WS"

When verdict == promote, clear harness_ws from $STATE (sed it blank) and
the main 7-step loop will advance to Step $(( STEP + 1 )) on next iteration.
